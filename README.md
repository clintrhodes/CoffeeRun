#CoffeeRun

Part of the interview process at my current employeer involved a "100 line challenge".  The task was to make something fun or cool in 100 lines or less.  

I struggled for a while coming up with a decent idea and I finally settled on writing a sokoban style puzzle game.  It was a great opportunity to dust of my photoshop skills and put a nice personal touch on the end product.  

While it's nothing fancy, the effort was certainly recognized (and I did get the job).  Over the years, people still talk about this as being one of the more fun submissions from an interview candidate, so I decided to post it up for future reference.
